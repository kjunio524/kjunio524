### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite because it was the beginning and a starting point for me. It was when I started to learn basic formatting and programming for C++. I was not familiar with the language before starting the class. So, making the program print out the words "Hello World!" was a fresh start for me.

* Lab 4, part 2

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorites because it was a game of Hi-Lo. Player two will have to guess a number that player one chose. This taught me how to use if-else statements and how to program hints the player can use. These hints are supposed to let player two know if they guessed too high or too low.

* Lab 5, part 2

    Lab 5, part 2 was one of my personal favorites because I was able to write functions and assign points to blackjack cards. This lab would also work as a foundation for future labs, such as lab 7. I am familiar with the game blackjack so coding for it allowed me to understand it much more.
